/*
 * Parse and normalize one MoQ media object.
 *
 * Stateless, allocation-free, no retained refs.
 *
 * The LOC property codec is selected by track->transport_version, and
 * ONLY when track->struct_size FULLY COVERS that field.
 *
 * Any valid struct_size that stops short of covering the whole field --
 * the frozen v0 prefix itself, or any partial prefix in between -- comes
 * from a caller that cannot express a version, so the legacy standalone
 * contract, draft-16, applies. A partially covered tail field is never
 * read: half a version is not a version.
 *
 * When the field IS fully covered the caller owns it and must name a
 * supported version: 0 is INVALID and does not masquerade as draft-16,
 * so a caller who cleared the struct by hand is refused rather than
 * silently given a codec.
 *
 * Returns MOQ_OK on success.
 * Returns MOQ_ERR_INVAL on bad struct_size, NULL required pointers,
 *   a covered-but-unsupported transport_version,
 *   invalid packaging/media_type, terminal with payload, normal
 *   without payload, or CMAF with zero timescale.
 * Returns MOQ_ERR_PROTO on media-level parse failure; if drop_reason
 *   is non-NULL, it is set to the specific reason.
 * Returns MOQ_ERR_BUFFER if the CMAF fragment has more samples than
 *   sample_cap; out->sample_count is set to the required count.
 *
 * Terminal statuses (END_OF_GROUP, END_OF_TRACK) return MOQ_OK with
 * status set and no timing/payload required.
 *
 * Capture timestamp is OPTIONAL (draft-ietf-moq-loc-01): a RAW/LOC object with
 * no LOC capture timestamp is NOT a parse failure -- it returns MOQ_OK with
 * has_capture_time=false and the timing fields (decode/composition/presentation)
 * left at 0. (It is therefore never dropped with MOQ_MEDIA_DROP_MISSING_TIMESTAMP
 * at this layer; a consumer that requires a presentation time enforces that
 * itself via has_capture_time -- e.g. the playback pipeline drops such objects.)
 * When the timestamp is present it drives decode/presentation time as usual.
